# Mapping Earthquakes
#### *Created visualizations of earthquake data from the U.S. Geological Survey using JavaScript's Leaflet library along with the Mapbox API.*

## Overview
This project consisted of supporting website and mobile application development by using the latest GeoJSON data on earthquakes around the World to create an interactive map visualization. The goal was to traverse these GeoJSON data files using JavaScript, D3, and Leaflet and then plot the data on a mapbox map to an API request. 

## Resources
- Software
  - JavaScript
  - D3, Leaflet and Mapbox
  - GeoJSON files
  - HTML
  - Visual Studio Code

## Results
The final result was an interactive map where the user can choose from 3 different map styles (street, satellite and dark) as well as toggle on and off between all earthquakes, tectonic plates and the major earthquakes.
